<h2> 🌐 English </h2>

- ⛏️ aknx_personalmenu its a personalmenu in rageui (v1), very optimized.
- ⛏️ Easy config, traductions, modder protection for triggers.
- 💻 The menu deit is taken from the "krz" (like the name of some buttons), but level there is only 5-10% of krz. Everything was coded 0 by us.
- 💻 The menu has many more features than the krz (administration, give logs, giving, etc. It’s up to you to test ^^).
- 💻 For see all options, watch preview video.
